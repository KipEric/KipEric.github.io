    <h2>About The Maze Project</h2>
    <p>The Maze Project was born out of a deep fascination with the enigmatic and perplexing nature of mazes. Inspired by
      childhood adventures and the desire to create an immersive and entertaining experience, we embarked on this
      journey.</p>
    <p>This project is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, where we honed our skills in software development and
      design. Throughout the development process, we poured our passion into every line of code and every pixel of the
      user interface.</p>
